You’ve just joined Cashback, the hottest crypto neobank in town. Their pitch is irresistible: for every on-chain payment you make, you earn points. Rack up enough and you’ll reach legendary status, unlocking the coveted Super Cashback NFT badge.

The system leverages EIP-7702 to allow EOAs to accrue cashback. Users must delegate to the Cashback contract to use the `payWithCashback` function.

Rumor has it there’s a back door for power users. Your brief is simple: become the loyalty program’s nightmare. Max out your cashback in every supported currency and walk away with at least two Super Cashback NFT badges—one of which must correspond to your player address.

Find the edges. Nudge the assumptions. Cash in.
